    required
        if 1 and no bodyparts will be found for required position, drawing process of character will be canceled

    point_1, point_2 - coordinates (x;y) of points on image
        bodypart image will be stretched and positioned according to this points, and points in "connections" of bodypart for this position
    instead of 2 points, one can be used:
